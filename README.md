House Cost Prediction:
This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning model to predict housing prices based on various features. 
The project leverages Python and popular libraries for data analysis, preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning.


I) Project Overview

The House Cost Prediction project aims to estimate the cost of a house using a machine learning model trained on historical data. 
This project can be a valuable tool for real estate professionals, buyers, and sellers, helping them make informed decisions based on accurate predictions.

II) Features

 - Data cleaning and preprocessing

 - Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

 - Feature engineering and selection

 - Model training and evaluation

 - Performance visualization

 - Exported model for reuse

III) Data

 - The dataset used for this project contains features such as:

 - Number of bedrooms

 - Square footage

 - Location

 - Year built

 - Amenities

The data is preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize numerical features, and encode categorical variables.

IV) Requirements

The project is implemented using the following libraries:

 - Pandas

 - NumPy

 - Scikit-learn

 - Matplotlib

 - Seaborn

V) Setup

 - Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HouseCostPrediction.git
    cd HouseCostPrediction

 - Create a virtual environment:
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  

 - Install the required dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

 - Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    jupyter notebook HouseCostPrediction.ipynb

VI) Usage

Load your dataset in the specified format. Run the Jupyter Notebook cells step-by-step to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
Modify the hyperparameters and model architecture as needed to improve performance.

VII) Results

The trained model achieves an accuracy of X% (replace with actual result) on the test dataset. 
Performance metrics and visualizations, including feature importance and residual plots, are included in the notebook.
